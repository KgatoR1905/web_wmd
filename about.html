  <h2>Our Legacy: The History of Arsenal FC</h2>

  <h3>Founding and Early Years (1886–1913)</h3>
  <p>
    Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 in Woolwich, South East London, by munitions workers from the Royal Arsenal. Originally named Dial Square, the club soon became Royal Arsenal and later Woolwich Arsenal after turning professional in 1891. In 1893, they joined the Football League as the first southern club to do so.
  </p>

  <h3>Move to North London and Identity Change</h3>
  <p>
    Financial struggles led the club to relocate in 1913 to Highbury in North London, where they dropped "Woolwich" and became known simply as Arsenal. This move not only changed the club’s trajectory but also sparked the fierce North London rivalry with Tottenham Hotspur that still endures today.
  </p>

  <h3>The Herbert Chapman Era and 1930s Success</h3>
  <p>
    Arsenal’s golden age began under manager Herbert Chapman in the 1920s and 1930s. Chapman revolutionized the club by introducing innovative tactics, numbered shirts, and enhanced professionalism. Arsenal secured their first First Division title in 1931 and dominated English football throughout the decade with multiple league and FA Cup victories.
  </p>

  <h3>Post-War Period and the 1970–71 Double</h3>
  <p>
    After World War II, Arsenal experienced a decline in dominance but remained competitive. A major highlight came in the 1970–71 season when under Bertie Mee, the club won both the league title and the FA Cup — Arsenal’s first ever double.
  </p>

  <h3>George Graham’s Discipline and Trophies (1986–1995)</h3>
  <p>
    In the late 1980s and early 1990s, George Graham brought success through disciplined, defensive football. The club won two league titles, including the dramatic 1989 title secured at Anfield, and added FA Cups, League Cups, and a European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1994 to their trophy cabinet.
  </p>

  <h3>The Arsène Wenger Revolution (1996–2018)</h3>
  <p>
    Arsène Wenger’s arrival in 1996 transformed Arsenal on and off the pitch. He brought a fluid, attacking playing style and modern training methods. Under his guidance, Arsenal won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups. The 2003–04 season stands out as the team went unbeaten to become “The Invincibles.” Wenger also oversaw the move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006, which enhanced the club’s global stature.
  </p>

  <h3>Transition and New Leadership</h3>
  <p>
    Wenger’s departure in 2018 ushered in a transitional phase with mixed fortunes under Unai Emery and interim manager Freddie Ljungberg. In 2019, former player Mikel Arteta took over. He led Arsenal to FA Cup victory in 2020 and began rebuilding with a young, talented squad and a modern tactical approach.
  </p>

  <h3>Arsenal Today</h3>
  <p>
    Arsenal is now a global football powerhouse known for its heritage, attacking philosophy, and a deeply loyal fanbase. With 13 league titles and a record 14 FA Cups, the club continues to compete at the highest levels, aiming to reclaim both domestic and European success under Mikel Arteta's leadership.
